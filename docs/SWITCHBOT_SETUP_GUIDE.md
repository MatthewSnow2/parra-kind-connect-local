- Check that status updates appear in real-time
- Wave your hand in front of the sensor - app should show "Motion Detected"

---

## Part 4: Get Device MAC Address

You'll need the sensor's MAC address to register it in the Para system.

### Method 1: Via SwitchBot App

1. Open SwitchBot app
2. Go to your Motion Sensor device
3. Tap the **‚öôÔ∏è settings icon** (top right)
4. Scroll down to find **"Device Info"** or **"MAC Address"**
5. It will look like: `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` or `AABBCCDDEEFF`

### Method 2: Via API (Advanced)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.switch-bot.com/v1.1/devices" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "sign: YOUR_SIGNATURE" \
  -H "t: TIMESTAMP" \
  -H "nonce: RANDOM_STRING"
```

Look for `"deviceType": "Motion Sensor"` in the response.

**Save this MAC address** - you'll enter it in the Para admin panel.

---

## Part 5: Configure Para System

### Step 1: Add SwitchBot Credentials to Supabase

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Edge Functions**
2. Add these environment variables:

```
SWITCHBOT_TOKEN=your_token_from_step2
SWITCHBOT_SECRET=your_secret_from_step2
SWITCHBOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=generate_random_string (optional for security)
```

To generate a webhook secret:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Step 2: Get Your Webhook URL

Your Supabase webhook URL will be:

```
https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/switchbot-webhook
```

Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` with your actual Supabase project reference ID.

**Example**: `https://abcdefghijklmno.supabase.co/functions/v1/switchbot-webhook`

### Step 3: Register Webhook with SwitchBot

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: As of SwitchBot API v1.1, webhook registration must be done via API (not in the app).

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.switch-bot.com/v1.1/webhook/setupWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "action": "setupWebhook",
    "url": "https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/switchbot-webhook",
    "deviceList": "ALL"
  }'
```

**Verify webhook is set:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.switch-bot.com/v1.1/webhook/queryWebhook" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN"
```

You should see your webhook URL in the response.

### Step 4: Register Sensor in Para Admin Panel

1. Log in to Para as **Admin**
2. Go to **Admin Dashboard** ‚Üí **Motion Sensors**
3. Click **"Register New Sensor"**
4. Fill in:
   - **Device MAC**: `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` (from Part 4)
   - **Device Name**: "Bathroom Sensor" (or your chosen name)
   - **Patient**: Select the patient this sensor monitors
   - **Location**: "Bathroom" (or room name)
   - **Inactivity Threshold**: 30 seconds (default for testing)
   - **Escalation Time**: 10 minutes (default)
5. Click **"Save"**

---

## Part 6: Configure Patient WhatsApp Number

For fall detection alerts to work, patients need WhatsApp numbers configured.

1. In Para Admin Panel, go to **Users** or **Patients**
2. Select the patient
3. Find **"WhatsApp Phone"** field
4. Enter phone number in international format: `14694502967` (no + or spaces)
5. Click **"Save"**

**Test the number:**
- Send a test WhatsApp message to verify it's correct
- Make sure the patient has WhatsApp installed and active

---

## Part 7: Test the System

### Test 1: Motion Detection

1. **Wave your hand** in front of the sensor
2. Check **Supabase logs**:
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí `switchbot-webhook` ‚Üí Logs
   - You should see: `"Motion event processed successfully"`

3. Check **Para database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM motion_sensor_events
   ORDER BY recorded_at DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
   You should see `"DETECTED"` events

### Test 2: Inactivity Detection

1. **Leave the sensor area** (no motion for 30+ seconds)
2. After 30 seconds, check logs - should see `"inactivity_monitoring_started"`
3. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM inactivity_monitoring
   WHERE resolved_at IS NULL;
   ```

### Test 3: Check-In Message

1. Wait 30 seconds of inactivity
2. Check patient's WhatsApp - should receive check-in message
3. **Respond to the message** (any text)
4. System should mark monitoring as resolved

### Test 4: Escalation (Optional)

1. Start inactivity (leave the area)
2. DO NOT respond to the check-in WhatsApp message
3. Wait 10 minutes
4. Caregivers should receive escalation alert via WhatsApp

### Test 5: Motion Resumes (Auto-Resolve)

1. Start inactivity
2. Before check-in is sent, **move in front of sensor**
3. System should automatically resolve monitoring
4. No WhatsApp messages should be sent

## Troubleshooting

### Motion Sensor Not Detecting

**Problem**: Sensor doesn't detect motion in the app

**Solutions**:
- Check battery level (in app)
- Sensor might be in "sleep mode" - press button to wake
- Ensure sensor is within 30-50 feet of Hub
- Check Hub is online (LED should be solid)
- Restart Hub by unplugging for 10 seconds

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

**Problem**: No events showing up in Supabase logs

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook is registered:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://api.switch-bot.com/v1.1/webhook/queryWebhook" \
     -H "Authorization: YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```
2. Check Cloud Services is enabled in app
3. Verify webhook URL is correct (no typos)
4. Check Supabase Edge Function is deployed
5. Look for errors in Supabase function logs

### WhatsApp Messages Not Sending

**Problem**: Patient/caregiver not receiving alerts

**Solutions**:
- Verify phone number format (no + or spaces): `14694502967`
- Check Evolution API credentials in Supabase environment variables
- Verify Evolution API instance is running
- Check send-whatsapp-notification function logs
- Test Evolution API directly with a manual message

### False Alarms (Pets, Shadows)

**Problem**: Too many false inactivity alerts

**Solutions**:
- Increase **Inactivity Threshold** to 60-120 seconds
- Reposition sensor away from pet areas
- Mount higher (7-8 feet) to avoid pets
- Adjust sensor angle away from windows
- Consider adding "quiet hours" (future feature)

### API Rate Limit Errors

**Problem**: "Rate limit exceeded" errors

**Solutions**:
- SwitchBot allows 10,000 API calls per day
- Webhook events don't count toward this limit
- If polling, reduce frequency
- Check for infinite loops in code

---

## API Limits & Best Practices

**SwitchBot API Limits**:
- ‚úÖ 10,000 API calls per day (webhook events don't count)
- ‚úÖ Webhooks are unlimited
- ‚úÖ Motion Sensor sends events immediately (no polling needed)

**Best Practices**:
- ‚ú® Use webhooks exclusively (don't poll for motion status)
- ‚ú® Keep webhook endpoint responsive (<5 seconds)
- ‚ú® Log all events for debugging
- ‚ú® Test inactivity thresholds per-patient (some move more than others)
- ‚ú® Adjust escalation times based on patient risk level
- ‚ú® Place sensors strategically (focus on fall-risk areas)

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Sensors per Patient

You can register multiple sensors for one patient:

1. Bathroom Sensor ‚Üí 30 second threshold
2. Bedroom Sensor ‚Üí 2 hour threshold (sleep)
3. Hallway Sensor ‚Üí 60 second threshold

Each sensor can have different inactivity settings.

### Time-Based Rules (Future Feature)

Planned: Different thresholds by time of day:
- 8am-10pm: 30 second threshold (active hours)
- 10pm-8am: 2 hour threshold (sleep hours)

### Integration with Health Metrics

Future: Combine motion data with:
- Heart rate (from wearables)
- Sleep patterns
- Activity trends
