## PHI Protection Summary

### Critical PHI Tables (Highest Protection)
- `check_ins` - Health conversations, mood, safety concerns
- `daily_summaries` - Health metrics, medication compliance
- `alerts` - Safety alerts, health incidents
- `caregiver_notes` - Clinical notes, observations

**Protection Level**:
- ✅ Access limited to patient and authorized caregivers only
- ✅ Permission-based access (can_view_health_data, can_receive_alerts)
- ✅ Caregivers have read-only access to check_ins
- ✅ Patients cannot dismiss their own critical alerts (safety)
- ✅ All access logged for audit trail

### High PHI Tables (Strong Protection)
- `profiles` - PII/PHI (names, DOB, contact info)

**Protection Level**:
- ✅ Users can only view/modify their own profile
- ✅ Cannot change own role (privilege escalation prevention)
- ✅ Admins have oversight capability

### Medium PHI Tables (Controlled Access)
- `care_relationships` - Care network structure
- `activity_log` - User actions (may contain PHI in metadata)

**Protection Level**:
- ✅ Only parties involved can view
- ✅ Patient controls access
- ✅ Immutable audit trail

### Low PHI Tables (Limited Access)
- `waitlist_signups` - Pre-registration data

**Protection Level**:
- ✅ Admin-only access
- ✅ Public can insert (signup)

## Key Security Features

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Database-level RLS policies
- Application-level business logic
- API-level rate limiting
- Authentication layer (Supabase Auth)
- Audit trail (activity_log)

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users see only what they need
- Permissions are explicit, not implicit
- Access requires active care relationships
- Granular permission flags

### 3. Safety-Critical Controls
- Patients cannot dismiss their own alerts
- Caregivers have read-only access to check_ins
- Activity logs are immutable
- Users cannot escalate their own privileges

### 4. Audit Trail
- All database operations logged by Supabase
- Custom activity_log for application events
- PHI access can be tracked
- Support for breach investigation

### 5. Emergency Access
- Admin role for break-the-glass scenarios
- Service role bypasses RLS for system operations
- Emergency procedures documented
- All emergency access must be logged

---

## Performance Optimization

### Indexes Created
- `idx_profiles_role_id` - Fast role-based queries
- `idx_care_relationships_caregiver_status` - Fast caregiver lookups
- `idx_care_relationships_patient_status` - Fast patient lookups
- `idx_care_relationships_permissions` - Fast permission checks

### Expected Query Performance
| Query Type | Target Time | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| SELECT own profile | < 1ms | Single row lookup |
| SELECT own check_ins | < 5ms | Indexed by patient_id |
| SELECT with care relationship | < 10ms | Uses RLS indexes |
| Complex JOINs | < 20ms | Multiple table access |

### Optimization Features
- Helper functions use `SECURITY DEFINER STABLE` (cached)
- Indexes on all foreign keys and common filters
- Efficient subquery design in policies
- No N+1 query problems introduced

---

## Testing Coverage

### Automated Tests (11 Suites)
1. ✅ Profiles table access control
2. ✅ Care relationships CRUD operations
3. ✅ Check-ins PHI protection
4. ✅ Daily summaries access control
5. ✅ Alerts safety features
6. ✅ Caregiver notes sharing
7. ✅ Activity log immutability
8. ✅ Waitlist public access
9. ✅ Helper function validation
10. ✅ Cross-cutting security
11. ✅ Performance benchmarks

### Manual Test Scenarios
- Patient-caregiver relationship flow
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Admin operations
- Edge cases (inactive relationships, permission changes)
- HIPAA compliance verification

## Risk Assessment

### Risks Mitigated ✅

- **Unauthorized Data Access**: ✅ RLS prevents access to unauthorized data
- **Privilege Escalation**: ✅ Users cannot change their own roles
- **Data Breach**: ✅ Data isolation prevents bulk data access
- **HIPAA Violations**: ✅ Compliance controls implemented
- **Audit Failures**: ✅ Activity logging implemented
- **Safety Incidents**: ✅ Patients cannot dismiss critical alerts

### Remaining Risks ⚠️

- **Application Bypass**: RLS doesn't protect against application-level vulnerabilities
- **Service Role Misuse**: Service role key must be protected (bypasses RLS)
- **Admin Account Compromise**: Admin accounts need strong security
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor query performance continuously

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Application Security**: Implement additional validation in application code
2. **Key Management**: Secure service role keys, rotate regularly
3. **Admin Access Control**: MFA for admins, regular access reviews
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up alerts for slow queries
